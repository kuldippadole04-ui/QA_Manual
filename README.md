# OrangeHRM – Manual Testing Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete manual testing workflow performed on the **OrangeHRM** web application — an open-source Human Resource Management system built using **PHP**, **MySQL**, and hosted on **Apache HTTP Server**.  
The application supports both Linux and Windows environments and provides HR modules such as ESS, Leave Management, Recruitment, Time Tracking, and Performance Management.

The project demonstrates the full STLC cycle from requirement analysis to defect reporting with clear, structured testing artifacts.
